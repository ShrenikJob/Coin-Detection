# Coin Detection
Program to read and detect Australian coins on an image using Roboflow. 

**I have made it very easy to follow here with simple words and easy steps!**

# 1) Description of Project
This project aims to use Roboflow to detect coins in your own images!!

Use Roboflow to **insert the entire coins folder above and run your code.**

(I used the premium Free Trial which requires no credit card details. You may have to use the free trail premium feature too).

# 2) Next Steps

After uploading, follow the process shown in RoboFlow with training and running the model.

**Feel free to experiment with the ratios of Train : Validate : Test sets**

While preparing the images, you can experiment with Preprocessing and Augmentation.

Next, you can choose to "Custom Train and Upload" or "Train with Roboflow". I chose to to go with "Train with Roboflow" in this instance.

(Note, this will take some time to train).

Here are the results from my side:

# 3) Try the Model

Within the "Versions" tab, you can choose to try the model by uploading a photo of Australian Coins, or you can scan the QR code using your mobile phoneto try the model live with video.

This truly is fascnitating and I encourage you all to experiment with this project.

# Thank you
